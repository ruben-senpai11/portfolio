                    <p >I printed my first <span className="font-mono bg-zinc-300 m-1 p-1 " >Hello World!</span> 5 years ago. It was in python,
                      and then with my electronic background, I was entirely focused on robotic with Arduino these years </p>
                    <p>I've learned Python after it and was inducted to web development on school</p>
                    <p>When I think of it , it was a huge way to arrive here. I've been through many technologies, and defintely found myself in frontend development and web design</p>

                  <p>As most of devs, I've started this work looking to have geographic liberty and a way to use creativity,
                    but I had to throw myself in professionnal life to see what it really is</p>
                  <p>Even though I have experience in building applications from A to Z, the most expectative the project is about
                    creativity, User Interface & Experience, the more comfortable I am</p>

                  <p>Then, since my 2 last jobs, I decided to specialize myself as frontend.</p>
                  <p> This is the perfect job ror me, it enhance my productivity and I enjoy it like a kid</p>
