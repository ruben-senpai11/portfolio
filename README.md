## The White_developer portfolio

This repo is home for the codebase that powers my entire website.

## Project setup

First, install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

As I aim coding with the less dependencies possible, this is all you need
